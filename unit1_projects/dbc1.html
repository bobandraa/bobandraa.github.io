	 <h1>Welcome!!</h1>
	 <h2>A little about me..</h2>
</div>
 <h3>
 <p class="center">

	I graduated with a Bachelors in Science in Cognitive Science with a focus in human-computer interaction which inspired me to pursue human factor engineering and user interface... blah blah blah... 
	<br>
	<br>
	I prefer not to define myself based on a piece of paper that is slowly proving to have no value! I'm orignally born and raised in LA and have been slowly crawling my way up California's coast. I love being outdoors, doing yoga any chance I get, and cook ...errr... mainly just eating :) Once you get to know me, my addiction to music (especially live) will become obvious. Feel free to check out my rdio account <a href="http://www.rdio.com/people/noizkisses/">here</a>

<h4>
	Some things that are a <i>little</i> less obvious:
	<ul>
		<li>My unwaivering love for <b>ZOMBIES!</b></li>
		<li>Everyone in my family (other than my Dad out in Palm Desert) lives in Israel</li>
		<li>My idea of a good time is driving out to the desert with good homies shooting guns and bbqing.</li>
	</ul>
 <h4>
	<h6>Hmmm.. What else??</h6>
 <h5>
    Here's a list of movies I'll <i>never</i> get sick of:
		<ol>
			<li>Seven Psychopaths</li>
			<li>28 Days Later</li>
			<li>Office Space</li>
			<li>City of God</li>
			<li>Blow</li>
		</ol>
    </h5>
