	I graduated with a Bachelors in Science in Cognitive Science with a focus in human-computer interaction which inspired me to pursue human factor engineering and user interface... blah blah blah... I prefer not to define myself based on a piece of paper that is slowly proving to have no value! I'm orignally born and raised in LA and have been slowly crawling my way up California's coast. I love being outdoors, doing yoga any chance I get, and cook ..er.. mainly just eating :) Once you get to know me, my addiction to music (especially live) will become obvious. Feel free to check out my rdio account<a href="http://www.rdio.com/people/noizkisses/">here</a>

	Some things that are a <i>little</i> less obvious:
	<ul>
		<li>My unwaivering love for <b>ZOMBIES!</b></li>
		<li>Everyone in my family (other than my Dad out in Palm Desert) lives in Israel</li>
		<li>My idea of a good time is driving out to the desert with good homies shooting guns, and bbqing.<li>
	</ul>

	Hmmm.. What else?

    <h3> Here's a list of movies I'll never get sick of:
		<ol>
		<li>Seven Psychopaths</li>
		<li>28 Days Later</li>
		<li>Office Space</li>
		<li>Blow</li>
		</ol>
