		  		Rdio is an online music service that supplies its users with a large collection of music. The organization of this page is solving the problem of accessing an extensive amount of music on one page. It provides users the ability to navigate to their music collection, history, playlists, stations, playback controls, friends&#39; collections and much more all on the main profile page. It is organized in a logical and visual appealing way as well. I currently do not see any visual challenges; then again, I may be a bit biased :)

		  		Imgur is an online image hosting service that has contributed to hours of procrastination during my undergrad. It was initially created however, to enable users to share their pictures from their computer to various online platforms. The front page visually stimulates users and makes it easy to get lost in an overaubance of funny, cute, and/or interesting images. Sure the section to the right provides users with the tools and links needed to upload their images but a large portion of the home page seems to be dedicated to browsing through images. The only visual challenge I see is that the environment is a little dark and dim. Maybe it is another way to keep users focused on the main attraction; the image! Also, re-posts. . .

		  		Littleco.com solves company-branding issues. They redesign company logos and sites with the claim that they help &quot;develop a deeper and more meaningful connection with consumers.&quot; They have a very image heavy homepage and I feel like it may pose a problem fully navigating from the homepage.
