			<li>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</li>
			    Imgur.com is a fun site to spend time on while taking a break from coding!
			<li>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</li>
			    My eye is drawn to all the silly or cute pictures located in the main container of the page.  Even when taking a step back, my eye is still drawn to all the images and judging by it’s name, I believe images are the most important area of the site :P
 			<li>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. </li>
				Imgur.com is <i>clustered</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>straightforward</i>, <i>captivating</i>, and <i>simple.</i>
			<li>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</li>
				Imgur.com is a cure for boredom. Oh yea, it also it’s an online image hosting service.
			<li>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</li>
				The sites content, focus, or purpose could be described as <i>funny</i>, <i>cute</i>, <i>current</i>, <i>silly</i>, and 
				<i>practical.</i>  There is a contrast with the adjectives used to describe the site visually. I think they wanted a simple and plain environment for the unforgettable images that they host.
			<li>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</li>
				Again, it’s easy to find pages because all available pages are linked to the top navigation.
			<li>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</li>
				Browsing is as easy as clicking the “next” button to flip through the images.
			<li>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? </li>
				Depending on how long I spend on it I can either feel like a wasted a lot of time or I feel much amaze, such happy- wow :)
			<li>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</li>
				Yes, they offer a “pro account” for users to receive more features. In addition to image hosting, imgur also has a store that sells shirts, stickers, pillows etc. I haven’t purchased anything because I haven’t really needed more than the basic image hosting functionality they offer.
