    	<h2>Why Javascript?</h2>

			Javascript (JS), not to be confused with Java, is a heavily supported  &amp; dynamic computer programming language.  JS may have had humble beginnings but has since grown immensely over the last decade in scope and application. This scripting language has been around for nearly twenty years, which has allowed for other frameworks and libraries to flesh out its capabilities.  It’s capacity to interpret and automate the execution of tasks is what makes JS a scripting language but why to its’ self-proclaimed followers consider it to be the “ultimate scripting language”??

			+ p r o s 
				-Libraries! Developers have written several helpful libraries to support the language and allow users to easily manipulate web pages with very few lines of code.
				-Easy to learn! With a considerable amount free online of tutorials and resources and since it’s widely standardized across common browsers,  Javascript has become easier than ever to pick up.
				-Prototyping! This opens the door for rapid development that would not be possible in a more structured language.
				-Speed! Very fast because it reduces load on server.
				-Support! Large helpful open source community.
				-Debug! With the use of Chrome Dev Tools, users are easily able to debug.
				-Default! JS  is already embedding in browsers.
				-Node.js! Incredibly more powerful asynchronous language being used to handle the role of server side language as well.


			- c o n s 
				-Reliance! Can be interpreted differently in different browsers resulting in an unpredictable experience.
				-Security! Since Javascript runs on the client-side, it presents a variety of security concerns and in some cases may be exploited for malicious purposes.
				-Access denied! Web pages hosted on different domains can’t be accessed.
